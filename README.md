R programming stuff

### What is R ?
Check out the official page [here](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)

### Why R ?
`R` is simple, interative and very funny language! I prefer `R` when it comes to tabular data. You can find [my article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-i-start-r-programming-vijay-lakhujani "How-do-i-start-with-R-programming-?") on how to start with R programming.

This repository consists of my day to day tasks accomplished in `R` programming. It includes basic parsing, tabulating, manipulating and plotting genomics/or simple textual data.
